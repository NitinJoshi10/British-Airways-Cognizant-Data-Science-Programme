# British-Airways Data Science Programme
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Data Science Programme offered by British Airways.

### Task 1

- Applied web scraping techniques to extract unstructured data from [Airline Quality](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).
- Analyzed customer reviews using sentiment analysis to categorize them as positive or negative.
- Created a PowerPoint presentation to showcase insights and analysis derived from the data.

### Task 2

- Developed a classification model to predict customer buying behavior.
- Prepared a PowerPoint presentation to present insights and analysis derived from the classification model.
